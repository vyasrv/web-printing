By using smart approaches like biometric fingerprint scanners, RFID cards, QR code scanning, or facial recognition, this system streamlines attendance operations. Management for subject-wise attendance is also one of the prominent features of this system. To reduce manual errors like missed entries and proxy attendance, this system uses advanced approaches.',

These reports are visually understandable, which makes them comparative. All data ranging from daily to yearly is accessible with the system, while accessing student-wise reports is also an average task, now. Further, percentage-based auto-calculations of absences for eligibility to stay in school are also a smart addition to this system. All these reports are accessible in the form of bar graphs, heat maps and downloadable Excel/PDF files, which make this system even more efficient.',

Itâ€™s a specific module that is perfectly designed for non-teaching and faculty staff let us track and manage their attendance. This module offers everything about clock-in/clock-out times, while data about leaves and half leaves of staff is also accessible with this tool. The integration of this module into all systems helps administration in payroll operations like salary calculations.  Through automated calculation of all salary on based on staff attendance, this module really helps large institutes.',

Rather than admins and teachers, parents also have the authority to access the database and check the real-time attendance status of their children. For teachers, this module is a game changer, and they can track attendance even on the go due to its seamless accessibility. When we count students, they can just open their attendance sheets and check their eligibility to apply for a leave. In the form of this accessible module, we really bring transparent access to the attendance database to each stakeholder.',

Specifically, parents who really care too much about their children will now get instant notifications about whether their children are attending class or missing it. This is really a cool approach to this system to encourage students to register the highest possible accountability while keeping parents aware of every small happening. In additional functionalities of this module, notifications sending for low attendance warnings, departmental absence and late arrival summaries are all available. ',

This helps in upgrading the system by integrating modern technologies like RFID-based smart ID cards, biometric devices and AI-based facial recognition cameras. In further integrations, GPS-based attendance for field activities and the use of personal phones or school tablets to mark attendance remotely or within the classroom via secure login are also possible with this system. No need for costly adjustments; you can start the process by just integrating used items like cameras and existing biometric/RFID devices.',
