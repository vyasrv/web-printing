  "description": "Integrated tools in our learning management systems help teachers in creating and designing content. After they upload content direct to the different files on base of content type, all the content in the form of videos, PDFs, quizzes, assignments, and presentations is seamlessly available to students through just using file filters. The availability of courses in the form of modules and chapters makes navigation easier for students. Further, the addition of multimedia content is also possible, which helps in offering rich content while teachers or students can only access the content as per their role-based access",

  "title": "Student Progress Tracking & Analytics Dashboard",
  "description": "Days are gone when student’s performance was analyzed on guesses. Our LMS gives opportunities to teachers to take detailed analytics that help them improve teaching strategies and student outcomes. Both individual and batch-level performance reports are easy to access with their quiz scores and course completion rates. This data is available in the form of visual graphs that are all collectively exportable. Teachers can also get alerts regarding those students who are not performing well or facing struggles due to their less time spending behavior on education modules.",

  "title": "Multi-User Roles & Access Control",
  "description": "We, as a leading school software development company in India, know exactly the pain points of schools. Data integrity matters a lot here, while getting stuck in information overload is also common here. We sort out this problem by giving role-based access to every stakeholder. Admins can access all kinds of data through a centralized dashboard, while teachers can only manage courses and grade students. Despite this, student’s access is limited to their study material, while parents can view their child’s performance and attendance.",

Automated reminders for classes and assignments are sent automatically. Teachers can also send specific sudden notifications to students regarding near future happenings. The administration also has the authority to make sudden announcements that can be made visible on dashboards or via push alerts. We aim to ensure no deadlines are missed and keep students aware of their learning journey status.",

  "description": "Evaluation is the biggest burden of teachers because it takes a lot of energy and time but no more. Now, teachers can design, distribute, and evaluate assessments seamlessly due to the integration of a powerful testing engine. It is easy for teachers to create and share MCQs, short answers, essays, match-the-column and fill-in-the-blanks. The system auto-checks objective answers and offers instant feedback to students. In the end, calculated marks are easy to add to student profiles or grade books.",
