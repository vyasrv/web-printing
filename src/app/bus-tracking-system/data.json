      "description": "The integration of advanced GPS in every bus lets admins and authorized entities access the real-time locations. Detailed visibility on digital maps keeps them aware of each activity of buses, whether it is unexpected stops or traffic delays. Further, this addition lets institutes keep an eye on unethical activities like detours, over-speeding, and unauthorized halts. Whether it's a single vehicle or an entire fleet, school administrators can track their movement second by second. Despite them, there are some innovative features are also available in which the conclusion of estimated arrival times, distance covered, and expected drop-off times are included.",

      "description": "Every student owns an RFID tag, which makes it easy to handle the check-in and check-out data of students. This way, it ensures precise tracking of every student’s journey and keeps both the institute and parents aware through continuous notifications. The same thing, when done by humans, causes manual errors, which leads to fatal conditions like the loss of children due to improper counting. However, this data is also valuable for auditing, incident reporting, and confirming safe travel. ",

      "title": "Geofencing Alerts",
      "description": "With geofencing integration, institute administration can set boundaries for buses to prevent unauthorized route choices. When a bus enters restricted areas like school premises and student neighbourhoods, the system automatically notifies the responsible people and lets them take prevention steps. This detecting deviations or suspicious activity collectively helps schools manage students' safety and ensures their safe home & school arrivals. To make it even safer, enhancing operational control is also possible for admins by setting alerts if a bus arrives at school too early, too late, or outside approved hours.",

That is why the administration has the authority to offer role-based access to everyone. Transport managers, drivers, school admins, and parents all have separate dashboards that let them see data just according to their responsibilities. Multi-level access permissions and encryption protocols make the platform robust and prevent data breaches while ensuring that sensitive data is viewed only by authorized personnel also fall under its responsibility.

This proactive vehicle management encourages you to keep your fleet in top condition. Scheduling maintenance cycles, setting reminders for vehicle servicing, monitoring fuel efficiency, and tracking wear and tear of critical parts are all the main features of the system that make it easy for you to keep maintenance patterns in mind. Accessing data regarding past maintenance, insurance expiry, and emission checks is also possible with this system, which helps institutes to have transportation compliant with transport laws.",

On the basis of the quote, “Modern problems require modern solutions”, we add intelligent algorithms that optimize routes based on real-time factors like traffic conditions, road closures, and student pickup density. Further, admins also have the authority to modify or create new routes to assign drivers that help in escaping through any inconvenient situations. Further, this system helps reduce chaos that is caused due to last-minute delays, which helps in making all the stakeholders punctual. ",
