      "title": "Smart Room Allocation",
      "description": "Days are gone when the room was allocated to students on the base of guesses while doing a lot of paperwork through registers and Excel sheets was also mandatory, but now, smart solutions are available. This smart room allocation feature helps students get their required rooms that match predefined parameters such as gender, academic year, special needs, or personal preferences. Further, this system is scalable and helps you manage the hindered of students while also ensuring no double-bookings or under-utilized rooms. It even offers flexible room reassignment and roommate pairing suggestions on the basis of batch-wise allocation to streamline move-ins during the admission season.",

For enhanced security and productivity, the time to meet students remains limited and ends after a set duration. Further, this feature keeps the parents aware of who is coming to meet their children, which promotes transparency and accountability and also offers an extra layer of better hostel security control.",

Further, admins can manage the waste of inventories and extend asset lifespan by analyzing usage trends, calculating depreciation, and scheduling stock replenishments.",
