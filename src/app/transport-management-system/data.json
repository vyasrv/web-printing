      "title": "AI-Based Route Optimization",
      "description": "No more hassle of manual route planning using spreadsheets and guesswork because the system uses AI and data analysis like student’s check-ins/check-outs to recommend the most optimal routes for every bus. Further, it analyzes many other factors, which include real-time traffic data, road closures and weather conditions that help in generating efficient routes that reduce fuel usage and travel duration. The most important thing regarding this system is that route optimization is not static. On the basis of real-time factors, including student absenteeism, new admissions, or road construction, it offers the best alternative routes.",

      "description": "During bad weather or traffic jams, the domains face a plethora of calls from parents that all happen due to their anxiety while waiting for the school bus. With notifications like SMS, email, or app alerts, this feature automatically keeps parents informed with live updates about pickup and drop timings, delays, and location alerts. Rather than average communication, it also handles emergency communication in case of accidents, breakdowns, or rerouting. This way, parents stay notified instantly with verified information, minimizing panic and ensuring transparency.",

      "title": "Driver Behavior & Safety Monitoring",
      "description": "We think beyond and ensure bus safety not just by tracking its live location but by analyzing how it is being driven. By tracking key driver behaviours, including over-speeding, rapid acceleration, sharp turns, long idling, and sudden braking, we let the administration maintain high standards of professionalism. In advanced analytics, dashboards highlight patterns, send instant alerts for unsafe actions, and create driver profiles with performance scores that collectively help in reducing accidents, enhancing fuel efficiency, and building a culture of safety. Integration of dashcams or black boxes let's schools collect proof during disputes or emergencies.",

      "description": "Not losing the visibility of vehicles is the most important factor in this system, which exactly this system offers. This lets admins monitor the live location of every bus in their fleet with pinpoint accuracy, while parents can see bus movements on digital maps. Integration of geofencing technology makes this security layer more strong by sharing quick alerts whenever a bus enters or leaves predefined zones like school boundaries, residential areas, or pickup points. Further, its integration with ETA predictions also allows better trip planning, reduced waiting times, and fewer communication hassles.",

      "description": "Just fuel refills and clean-ups are not the real meaning of fleet management. The system includes a comprehensive vehicle maintenance scheduler that tracks every bus’s servicing timeline, part replacement history, pollution checks, insurance renewals, and driver documents. To prevent last-minute rushes and costly penalties, the system makes staff active by sending automated alerts that remind them of upcoming deadlines. Further, predictive maintenance and smarter budgeting are also possible through detailed performance analytical reports, which collectively have a longer vehicle lifespan and increased reliability.",

      "description": "Fee processes are a little complex because every student has a different distance, pickup zone, or service type, but this system, based on automated tools, generates invoices for custom transport charges. These can be reviewed, edited, or approved by admins before sending to parents. Paying through UPI, debit/credit cards, net banking, or digital wallets is all possible with this system, which offers an extra layer of comfort for every stakeholder, especially for parents. The system also tracks paid, pending, and overdue payments with automated reminders, receipts, and reconciliation reports",
